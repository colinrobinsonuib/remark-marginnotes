# Example Document

This document demonstrates the inline aside footnotes. Here's the first reference [+note1].
[+note1]: This is the definition for the first note. It can contain *Markdown* like emphasis and `code`.

Sometime later, we might reference it again [+note1].

Here's a second, different reference [+ref-abc].
[+ef-abc]: This definition belongs to the second reference.

We can still have normal[^fn] footnotes.
[^fn]: By normal, we mean gfm style footnotes

And there you go!
